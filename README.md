# UFOs
Berkeley Bootcamp - Module 11

## Project Overview
The website has been finished, and the article is ready to go, but after a final look at her work, Dana feels that it could be improved even more. Instead of filtering by a single item, why not provide her readers with the ability to filter by multiple factors? The ability to search a city or country or even combine a date with a location would make Dana's application that much more robust.
In this challenge, you will create additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability will allow users to filter the data by multiple factors.

The webpage and dynamic table Dana has built are working as intended, but Dana has decided she would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, she would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Resources
- Software: Javascript, HTML, D3, CSS, VS Code

## Challenge Overview
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

1. Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
2. Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
3. Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

## Challenge Summary
The purpose of this project was to develop a webpage for showcasing UFO sitings.  The webpage needed to be professionally designed using HTML and CSS. Interactivity needed to be added with Javascript and D3. D3 is a useful javascript library for working with data-driven websites.  A table of UFO sitings needed to be added to the site along with filtering capability to filter on the various columns.

My recommendation for further development would include removing the button to filter and instead have the table update automatically on change of a filtered value. In addition it would be ideal to add pagination to the table in case our results grow in size.
